Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
Japan and Russia, after enough simulations they both have a winning probability of 0% which is impossible
Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
after about 1000 after that the simulations have diminishing returns on accuracy
